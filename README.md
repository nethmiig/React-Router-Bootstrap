# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



React Router Project with Vite and React-Bootstrap
This project is a simple React application set up with Vite and enhanced with React-Bootstrap for styling. It includes a basic implementation of React Router and different components for a Home view, Blog view, Navigation, and a Contact form.

Getting Started
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the development server, and you can access the application at http://localhost:http://localhost:5173/.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

src directory contains the source code.
components directory includes React components.
Home.jsx: Component for the Home view.
Blog.jsx: Component for the Blog view.
Nav.jsx: Component for Navigation.
Contact.jsx: Component for the Contact form.
App.jsx is the main application component where React Router is implemented.
Other files include styling, configuration, etc.
Styling
The application uses React-Bootstrap for styling components. You can customize the styles further by referring to the React-Bootstrap documentation.

Home View
The Home view is implemented using the following React-Bootstrap components:

Card: Used for a styled container.
Form: Used for the input form.
Button: Used for interactive buttons.
Alert: Used for displaying success messages.
In the functionality of the email address input field, useState from React is used to control the state of variables such as email, setEmail, showSuccess, and setShowSuccess.

Feel free to extend and modify the components based on your project requirements.

Additional Libraries
The project uses Vite as a template for quick setup (npm create vite@latest your-project -- --template react) and includes React-Bootstrap for enhanced styling.

bash
Copy code
npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap
